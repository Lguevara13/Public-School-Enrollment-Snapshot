# Public-School-Enrollment-Snapshot

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of public school enrollment trends in New York City (NYC) using various open-source datasets related to NYC public schools. The primary focus was on understanding enrollment patterns, demographic factors, and their implications for education planning and policymaking. Included is the Public School Enrollment Demographic dataset (created and included for the purpose of this project) containing my Python queries that I wrote with the data outputs, and visulization charts.

The objective of this analysis is to explore trends in student enrollment and demographic patterns across different grades and administrative districts in New York City (NYC) public schools. By analyzing enrollment data and demographic factors, we aim to provide insights for education planning and policymaking to ensure equitable opportunities and improved educational outcomes for all students.

As a data analyst your project is to build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

## Key Questions

- What are the enrollment patterns across different grades and districts in NYC schools?
  
- How do demographics vary across elementary, middle, and high school grades, and what's the correlation with academic success?
  
- How do demographic trends vary between elementary, middle, and high school grades?
  
- How does socioeconomic status, as indicated by factors such as poverty level, students with disability, or english language learners, correlate with academic achievement and educational outcomes?
  
- How can demographic analysis inform strategies to improve educational outcomes citywide?

## Data

NYC Public School Enrollment Data: This dataset contains information about student enrollment across different grades and administrative districts in NYC public schools. It includes demographic details such as ethnicity, gender, economic status, English language proficiency, and disability status.

*NYC Public Data:*
- [Data Dictionary](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2013-2018-Demographic-Snapshot-School/s52a-8aq6/about_data)
- [School District map](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Districts/r8nu-ymqj)

## Tools

The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots)
- Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
- Regression analysis
- Cluster analysis
- Time-series analysis
- Analysis narrative and final results (presented in my dashboard)

## Folder

The project files are divided between the following folders:
- *01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.*
- *02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)*
- *03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.*
- *04 Analysis: Separated into two subfolders Reports and Visualizations. The Reports subfolder contains crosstabs and the Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.*
- *05 Sent to Client: The final report presented in Tableau*

## Resouces

Note: NYC Public School is a real institution thatâ€™s made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief have been created for CareerFoundry for the purpose of this analysis.
